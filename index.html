                        On the global poverty scale, while the USA is third largest by population, it is ranked a surprising 55th amongst all nations for poverty, according to United Nations data. The reported poverty rate is an astonishing <cite><a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/poverty-rate-by-country">17.8%</a></cite>.
                        Exact numbers will vary according to definitions, reporting reliability, and report objectives, but no one will dispute that the number of financially struggling Americans is very large.

                    <p class="heading-content">TZT Holdings, with its TranzactCard financial ecosystem, has been formed as a social impact enterprise to drive major increases in the purchasing power of those who need it most. TranzactCard has adopted former Harvard professor, Clayton
                        M. Christensen’s
                        <cite><a href="https://www.christenseninstitute.org/books/the-prosperity-paradox-how-innovation-can-lift-nations-out-of-poverty/?post_types=books">final book</a></cite> as its own handbook for how to use innovation to lift families
                        and communities out of poverty.

                    <p class="heading-content">
                        Consistent with those principles, TranzactCard resisted early inclinations to operate as a charitable foundation, opting instead to conduct its operations as a for-profit so that it would not have to be continuously obsessed with raising money which is
                        the bane of most not-for-profits. Though established as a for-profit enterprise, TranzactCard has no shareholders or members; the LLC membership interests are held in trust; the enterprise is governed by a board of directors supported
                        by a diverse and talented advisory council.

                        affordable, and a range of other initiatives, are all part of the TranzactCard ecosystem. Details will be released publicly throughout the course of 2022.
