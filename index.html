                        One of the standard definitions of poverty for the USA is when a family of four is living on an annual income of less than <cite><a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-09-24/federal-poverty-level-us-families">$25,200</a></cite>,
                        or an individual is living at or below the threshold of <cite><a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-09-24/federal-poverty-level-us-families">$12,760</a></cite>. By that standard, almost forty-million Americans <cite><a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-09-24/federal-poverty-level-us-families">live in poverty</a></cite>,
                        and tens of millions more Americans hover at or near that invisible indicator line. About <cite><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/70-of-americans-struggling-to-make-ends-meet-this-year-many-employees-rely-on-employer-programs-for- nancial-advice-and-support-301151078.html?tc=eml_cleartime">70% of adults</a></cite>                        say they are struggling to make ends meet. According to the FDIC, at least 7 million Americans are <cite><a href="https://www.fdic.gov/getbanked/">unbanked</a></cite> and about 50 million are considered <cite><a href="https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/2015/2015execsumm.pdf">underbanked</a></cite>.
                        On the global poverty scale, while the USA is third largest by population, it is ranked a surprising 55th amongst all nations for poverty, according to United Nations data. The reported poverty rate is an astonishing <cite><a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/poverty-rate-by-country">17.8%</a></cite>.
                        Exact numbers will vary according to definitions, reporting reliability, and report objectives, but no one will dispute that the number of financially struggling Americans is very large. TZT Holdings, with its TranzactCard financial
                        ecosystem, has been formed as a social impact enterprise to drive major increases in the purchasing power of those who need it most. TranzactCard has adopted former Harvard professor, Clayton M. Christensen’s <cite><a href="https://www.christenseninstitute.org/books/the-prosperity-paradox-how-innovation-can-lift-nations-out-of-poverty/?post_types=books">final book</a></cite>                        as its own handbook for how to use innovation to lift families and communities out of poverty. Consistent with those principles, TranzactCard resisted early inclinations to operate as a charitable foundation, opting instead to
                        conduct its operations as a for-profit so that it would not have to be continuously obsessed with raising money which is the bane of most not-for-profits. Though established as a for-profit enterprise, TranzactCard has no shareholders
                        or members; the LLC membership interests are held in trust; the enterprise is governed by a board of directors supported by a diverse and talented advisory council. All profits and dividends will be reinvested in the social impact
                        mission, which is to generate hundreds of thousands of part time and full time jobs, and also significantly impact the financial wellbeing of millions of individuals and families. Reaching inside the banking system, redistributing
                        relevant portions of the interchange fee; reaching inside manufacturers, vendors, and distributors production and pricing systems to make products and services more affordable, and a range of other initiatives, are all part of
                        the TranzactCard ecosystem. Details will be released publicly throughout the course of 2022.
